There are 3 kinds of animals: dog, cat and bird.  
Construct an 'Animal' Class, which has a member function virtual void walks() and its implementation.  
All animals are inherited from the 'Animal' Class and each one has its walks().  
Add virtual void fly()=0; into the 'Animal' Class and finish its implementations.
